## Flex Connectors
It is a good idea to route lines with EMI potential (for example, SPI clock) sandwhiched between 2 GND or between GND and VCC.

The target is to keep the length below 1/10th of the wavelength of the 5th harmonic, so that the connector is not considered a transmission line. This rule depends on the rise edge of the signal, and the overall frequency of the signal
