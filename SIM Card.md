## 1. SIM Card Role in LTE CAT-M1 Transmission
- **Authentication & Session Setup**: 
  - The SIM card is primarily accessed during the initial network connection for authentication.
  - The SIM contains the IMSI and a secret key (Ki), which are used to generate encryption keys (KASME, CK, IK) after authentication.
  
- **Session Persistence**: 
  - Once authentication is completed and encryption keys are established, these keys are used for securing subsequent data transmissions.
  - The SIM card is **not accessed for every individual transaction** during communication; instead, cached encryption keys are used.

- **Key Renewal**: 
  - Periodically, the network may re-authenticate and renew the encryption keys, at which point the SIM will be accessed again.

## 2. SIM Card Pins and Communication Frequency

- **SIM Card Pinout**:
  - **VCC (Pin 1)**: Power supply (1.8V or 3.3V)
  - **RST (Pin 2)**: Reset signal
  - **CLK (Pin 3)**: Clock signal
  - **GND (Pin 5)**: Ground reference
  - **VPP (Pin 6)**: Programming voltage (optional)
  - **I/O (Pin 7)**: Data line for communication
  - **Reserved (Pin 4 and 8)**: For future use or additional functionality

- **Communication Frequency**:
  - The typical communication frequency is **3.57 MHz**, with some SIM cards supporting higher frequencies (e.g., 4.5 MHz) for faster data exchange.
  - Communication follows the **ISO/IEC 7816** standard using a half-duplex serial protocol (T=0 or T=1).

## Sources and Standards
- This information is based on general LTE network architecture and SIM card communication standards, particularly the **3GPP TS 33.401** and **ISO/IEC 7816** specifications for SIM card functionality and communication protocols.
