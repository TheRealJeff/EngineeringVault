For JLCPCB:
- BOM must follow the exact column templates (find on JLC site)
	- Have one generated by Altium automated
	- Have another copy for JLC with modded columns
- Same advice for CPL (pick n place file) as BOM
- To get Solder Paste (putting tin/solder paste on all pads) on pads, write comment on order with the specific components that need it: "Add PCB Remarks"
	- Putting Solder paste makes it such that during assembly, one doesn't need to add more paste
