## Zener
Used for overvoltage protection.

Zener voltage (Vz): Voltage at which the diode will conduct when reverse biased. **MOST IMPORTANT VALUE**
Bias current: Current necessary for proper reverse bias conduction
Power: rated current for constant conduction. If the overvoltage is time limited, the rated power is generally higher

If the power rating of the zener diode is not adequate, use an "active zener diode circuit", example given in Art of Electronics p.692. Similar to crowbar circuit.


## Schottky

Diode with low forward voltage drop, high current density, high leakage current

Forward voltage drop (Vf): Voltage loss across diode during conduction or forward bias
Reverse voltage (Vr): Maximum voltage you can apply in reverse polarity
Leakage current (I @ Vr): Current leakage during reverse bias
Rectified current (Io): Maximum current during forward bias and regular conduction
Recovery time: Speed of transition from reverse to forward bias

## TVS
Used for short overvoltage protection.

Reverse standoff voltage: voltage at which point it is suppressed **MOST IMPORTANT VALUE**
