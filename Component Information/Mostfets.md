When checking MOSFETS, here are the following importants values
- Id: max current conduction
- Rds(on): resistance when turned on. Will vary depending on Vgs
- Vgs(th): determines the effective logic level of the components
- Vds: max voltage across the conducting pins
- Pin compatibility
- Package
