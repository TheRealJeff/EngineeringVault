## Bidirectional Load Switch
[TI Application Note](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva948/slva948.pdf)

For a setup with two PMOS with a common-source driven by a NMOS (reverse current blocking setup), there is direction of current flow that causes a bigger voltage drop due to the voltage. This in combination with the fact that it is after a H-bridge, therefore the voltage can be high or low.
