Here are the important values to check when selection an inductor:
- Isat: saturation current
- Irms: typical current rating
- DCR: conduction resistance, which determine the amount of heat
- Inductance value and percentage
- Shielding: if shielded, contains EMI
- Packaging: size of footprint, shielding and such

Choose Isat and Irms to be 50%-100% larger than the load current with ripple
