Certain manufacturers only list the pre-assembly theoretical thicknesses for the PCB stackup. However, pre-preg (resin/glue) shrinks during the assembly process, according to the amount of copper leftover from design, called residual copper.

| Step                               | Layer Composition                | Thickness (mm) |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Core with Cu (L2/L3)               | 0.23 + 0.035 + 0.035             | ~0.30          |
| After lamination (prepreg + foils) | +0.185 + 0.185 + 0.0175 + 0.0175 | ~0.71          |
| After plating                      | Outer Cu 1 oz total              | ~0.74          |
| After soldermask                   | +0.01–0.02 per side              | ~0.76          |
| After finish (ENIG)                | +0.005                           | ~0.765         |
| After finish (HASL)                | +0.02–0.05                       | ~0.79–0.81     |
| Final spec                         | Target 0.81 ±10%                 | 0.73–0.89      |
