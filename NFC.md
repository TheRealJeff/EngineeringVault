Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication method used in credit cards and such. It is a spin-off from common RFID tags. It can be used as a reader/writer (active and passive), card emulator and peer-to-peer communication.

Most tags and chips are made by NXP and ST, with a lot of proprietary layers encoded in the stackup.
