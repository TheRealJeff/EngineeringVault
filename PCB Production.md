## Files
Once all is correct, prepare the following documents and folders:
- In "Project Outputs", put the Gerber folder in the PCB Folder
- Delete uncessary files (Old schematic PDF, Old BOM, Old Step)
- Create zip version of the gerber folder for production
- In Project Folder, create zip backup of the Altium docs (.BomDoc, .OutJob, .PcbDoc, .SchDoc, .PrjPcb, .PrjPcbStructure, .PrjPcbVariants)
- Put zip backup in the PCB Folder, add to name `Altium Backup`
- Drop the PCB Folder in the GDRIVE: /Project/05 - Technical Work/ 02 - Electronic

- [ ] ENIG: All exposed copper is gold plated ( NO TIN APPLIED). Expensive
- [ ] HASL (Hot Air Surface Leveling): All exposed copper is dipped in tin, such that pads are covered by it. Might introduce bumps on pads (Care for BGA). Cheaper
