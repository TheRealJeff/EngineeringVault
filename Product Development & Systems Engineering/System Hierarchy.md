Organizational representation of a system structure using partitioning relationships.
Hierarchies are the **RESULT/PRODUCT** of analyzing and decomposing system elements

[[System]] -> Subsystem -> Component -> Subcomponent -> [[Part]]
### Context Dependent
The hierarchy is context dependent. A system in one hierarchy can be a subsystem in another.
### Domain Specific
- Physical hierarchy
- Behavior hierarchy
- Requirement hierarchy
- Organizational hierarchy
### Decomposition
The hierarchy should be decomposed until:
- You can hand off the object to design engineer/team
- You know you can make or buy the object in question
