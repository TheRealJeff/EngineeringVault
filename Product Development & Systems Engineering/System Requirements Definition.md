### Inputs
- [[Lifecycle Concepts]]
- Identified system functions/activities
- Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS)
- Stakeholder requirements traceability
- Initial Requirements Verification & Traceability Matrix (RVTM)
- Architecture traceability
- Final RVTM
- Lifecycle constraints
### Process
- Prepare for system requirements definition
	- How to [[Capture Requirements]]
	- Analyze previous products
	- Focus on interfaces
	- ICD: Interface Control Document
	- SEMP: System Engineering Management Plan
- Define system requirements
- Analyze system requirements
- Manage system requirements
### Outputs

	- Captured in SEMP
- System functional definition
- [[System Requirements Specification]] (SyRS)
- System functional interfaces identified (ICD Draft)
- Verification criteria
- Measures of Performance (MOPs)
- System requirements traceability
- Updated RVTM
- System requirements definition records
