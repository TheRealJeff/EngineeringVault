The limits that determine if an entity is a part of a [[System]] **and** is under the systems engineer's control ([[Internal entities]]) ***OR*** if the entity is a part of the operating environment ([[System Environment]]) **and** is not under the systems engineer's control ([[External entities]])

Use a [[Context Diagram]] to capture and communicate the boundaries.

Checklist -> Item ***IS WITHIN*** the system boundaries if:
- [ ] The organization has control over the entity's behaviors, development, requirements & funding
- [ ] Your organization has operation control of the entity after deployment. Missions are directed by the owner of the entity
- [ ] Your organization owns/controls the design details, functional & physical architectures (domains)

Another method:
- [ ] If a system requires that an entity must be developed or modified to suit that system's needs, then that entity is ***within*** the system boundaries
