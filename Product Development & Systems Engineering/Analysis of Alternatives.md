1. If predecessor systems exist, analyze/document minimal performance attributes, mission execution, etc.
2. Break the system down into smaller, more manageable segments
3. Re-evaluate the mission set. Attempt to refine/improve how current missions are executed. Weigh improvements against each system segment
4. Introduce alternatives that replace or improve each of the smaller segments. Focus on essential mission characteristics, cost, schedule, technical performance and feasibility (Use modelling, simulation, prototyping, etc. )
5. Combine/mix each chosen system segment
6. Continue introducing alternatives until 4 to 6 feasible alternatives have been identified
