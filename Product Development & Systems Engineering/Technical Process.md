1. [[Business & Mission Analysis]]
	1. Identify need/opportunity
	2. Discover business requirements
	3. Define business strategy
	4. Determine lifecycle approach
	5. Develop [[Business Requirements Specification]] (BRS)
2. [[Stakeholder Requirements Definition]]
	1. Decompose BRS into stakeholder requirements
	2. Formulate mission set (operational concept)
	3. Identify & elicit requirements from stakeholders
	4. Develop the Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS)
3. [[System Requirements Definition]]
