Characteristic of a need or problem:
- Complex and requires examination of issues, processes, and root cause(s)
- Systematic in nature
- Affects one or more stakeholder missions/goals
- Something your organization can solve

A single paragraph explaining what the current problem is, the impact of that problem and the identification of what the solution should address

### Outline
**Current state sentence**: In one sentence, describe the current state of the problem

**Impact sentence**: In one sentence, describe the impact the current state is having on the current or potential user's mission or goals

**Need statement**: In one sentence, modify the current state sentence to reflect what the "fixed" solution would be like when the need is met

### Characteristics
- Minimize adjectives
- No unnecessary background information (whys)
- No unnecessary words
- If able, apply quantifiable (measurable) characteristics
- Ensure it is a few sentences
- Ensure it is understood by all stakeholders, to include potential users/customers
- Does not dictate what the solution should be
### Review
- [ ] Does the problem lend itself to multiple alternative solutions?
- [ ] Is the problem statement limited to 3 to 5 sentences?
- [ ] Is there a quantitative measure included in your current and need states to allow you to determine if you have achieved success?
- [ ] Does the desired state mirror the current state?
- [ ] Are the sentences structured as simple statements of fact without opinions, causes, or solutions?
- [ ] Does the problem statement avoid discussing background information?
### Context
The need statement may be though of as the overarching requirement for the development of the system

Therefore, it is at the top of the requirements hierarchy and all other requirements are ultimately traceable to the need statement

While conducting requirements analysis, a rule of thumb is if the requirement you are writing does not help achieve the need, it is most likely not a true requirement. Exceptions include statutory, regulatory or interface constraints or other constraining requirements
