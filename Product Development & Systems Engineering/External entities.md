Items **Not** within the [[System Boundaries]] of the [[System]]:
- User(s), Stakeholders, maintainers, adversaries
- Weather/Environment (eg. electromagnetics)
- Other systems; friendly, neutral or adversarial

For the case of users, they are considered external as the system must respond to the behavior of the user. The system boundaries are then at the interface between the Users and the system, called the Human Machine Interface (HMI)
