- [[Writing Requirements]] and see [[Requirement Types]]
- Decompose StRS into SyRS
- Explore of use cases [[Lifecycle Concepts]] and [[Operational Concept]]
- [[Analysis of Alternatives]]
- Decompose System & Subsystem Functions
	- Child Functions are analyzed to see if parents Functions are feasible and can achieve Measure of Performance (MOP)
- Do Failure Mode Analysis
- Purpose: develop system requirements (SyRS)
- Maintain top-down relationships
- Cohesion/Modularity among functions
- Continuously "visualize" HOW functions will be performed
- **Always** record decision justifications
- Forward allocation: create physical elements within the system model and allocate each function of functional interface to them
	- Allocate each functional element to **ONLY ONE** physical element
	- Identify candidate HW & SW alternatives
