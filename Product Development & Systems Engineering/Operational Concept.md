Known as OpsCon

Captures user's needs & expectations of a potential [[System]]

Captures developer's understanding of how the system is expected to perform [[Mission]]s to fulfil the user's expectations

Captures agreement among multiple user groups or developers in concurrent, competitive development projects

- Appendix to specification or stand-alone document
- Decomposed as the system design matures
