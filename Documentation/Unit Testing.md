- Test as much as you can without firmware
- must setup board for easy debugging and testing
- mise en route check list should be longer, more detailed and procedural
- print the schematic when completing the testing
- can check funcitonality in its basica form (i.e. that it works, not that the values are correct)


- The mise en route document validates the schematic design/circuit design
- the matrix de validation validates the specification document
