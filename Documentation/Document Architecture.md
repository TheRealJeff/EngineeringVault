The architecture document answers the "How", and presents the technical solutions for the project.

- each requirement from the [[Document Specifications]] must be covered
- the architecture is sub-divided into functional blocks, which also correspond to the sections found in the [[Document Specifications]]
- each functional block covers 1 or more requirement
- Cannot have orphan requirements or functional block
	- if yes, add requirement or functional block to cover
	- if yes, remove extra if not needed by client's need
- Parts
	- Abstract
	- Block diagram (high level)
	- funcitonal blocks which correspond to the specification sections
		- detailed architecture and block diagram if required
		- design decisions justification
		- relate (trace back) to the specification requirements
- The architecture and the schematic must be done in parallel, and should be complete at the same time
- Include in the architecture document all "Notes de conceptions"
